Dear Rob,

Kindly find all necessary documentation int he github folder: https://github.com/lutharsanen/DeepLearning2048/tree/master/Project%20ShaLuMa
The report is made available as word and pdf. Please chose your favourite.

SARSA and Q-Learning have been compiled on our personal devices. 
DQN computations have been made through Google Colaboratory, therefore the skripts may not automatically be renderable on your device.
if needed, we can give permission to access the files directly on our google drive folder. 
Results should be available in the Jupyter Notebooks provided in the github repository.

what you'll need, apart from the standarts:
pip install gym
pip install gym-2048
pip install seaborn

There has been a problem with compatibility (different numpy versions) on Google Colab and the DQN scripts have multiple "install" "uninstall" "upgrade" commands not necessary otherwise.
These compatibility issues which did not persist on our devices with numpy 1.15.1

We hope this reports fulfills your expectations.

Best,
Lutharsanen & Matteo
